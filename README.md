# University-of-Uyo-Fall-Fest-2024
Qiskit Fall Fest 2024 for University of Uyo, Akwa Ibom, Nigeria

The Qiskit Fall Fest is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses worldwide. Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from the entire IBM Quantum team.

This inter-faculty wide Quantum Computing Event called **IBM Fall Fest**, is scheduled to begin on **20th November, 2024.**

We are thrilled to have all of you here. A team of volunteers from the University of Uyo proudly host this event.

The program is an initiative of IBM, a renown tech giant,  aimed at introducing students to the emerging field of quantum computing, which leverages quantum mechanics for advanced computation, offering new capabilities in areas like cryptography and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

The organisers of this event and the University of Uyo nominates two **Fall Fest participants from Nigeria** each year for its Quantum Computing Hackathon in Abu Dhabi. For two successive editions/years - 2023 and 2024 - students of University of Uyo made the pick. So far, University of Uyo is only behind University of Lagos as far as IBM Quantum Computing events are concerned in Nigeria. The exposure it promises our students is massive. This event is open not only to the Faculty of Engineering but also  Faculties of Science and Computing.
